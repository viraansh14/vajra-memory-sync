# hook-commit-on-write.ps1 - PostToolUse (Write|Edit): commit immediately after
# any memory write.
#
# This is the O2 fix. `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead` inspects the
# RECEIVING worktree, and the receiver is dirty exactly when it is mid-turn
# writing a memory - so an inbound peer push would be refused precisely when the
# peer is most active. Committing on write keeps the worktree clean between
# operations, so that window essentially closes.
#
# Cheap and silent by design: it must never slow down or interrupt a tool call.
# ASCII-only on purpose.
